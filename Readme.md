This is my Altschool Holiday Challenge

This Repository is to 
Set up 2 EC2 instances on AWS(use the free tier instances).
Deploy an Nginx web server on these instances(you are free to use Ansible)
Set up an ALB(Application Load balancer) to route requests to your EC2 instances
Make sure that each server displays its own Hostname or IP address. You can use any programming language of your choice to display this.

To Achieve this, I will be doing the following:

1. Creating a VPC with private and public subnets
2. Creating private instances in the private subnet of the VPC
3. Creating a bastion host to connect to the instances.
4. Installation and Configuration of Nginx Server on Private Instances Using Ansible
5. Creation of target groups
6. Creating and application of load balancerÂ 
etc
